Introduction:
- Sudoku is  popular is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In Japanese, the literal meaning of "Su-doku" is "the number that is single".

- The objective is to fill a nine-by-nine (9x9) grid with digits so that each column, row and 3x3 section contain all the integers between 1 and 9. Each number may be used only once in each section. The Sudoku game provides players with only a partially filled grid, and is meant to be solved.

- To solve sudoku one requires logic and reasoning, often taking between 10 to 30 minutes to complete each puzzle. However, more expert sudoku players can solve sudoku in around 5 minutes, and the elite players can manage sub-minute solutions. However, they pale in comparison to this simple python script, which can solve any possible sudoku puzzle in mere seconds.


Utility:
- Uses a built-in tkinter library to create a GUI
- Takes in an incomplete sudoku puzzle from the user
- Solves the puzzle in seconds using a backtracking algorithm
- Displays solution status (Either Solution Found, or No Solution Exists)

Requirements:
- No external libraries required for install.
